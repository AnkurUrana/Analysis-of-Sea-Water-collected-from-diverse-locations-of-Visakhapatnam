Analysis of Sea Water collected from diverse locations of Visakhapatnam
Visakhapatnam, a city of destiny, is surrounded by the beautiful beaches. It is a port city and industrial capital of Andhra Pradesh, India. In the last few decades, the sea water getting contaminated by various pollutants due to human activities and rapid industrialization. In this study, seawater samples collected from a different beaches of Visakhapatnam, India, were analyzed to determine the physicochemical characteristics. The pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solid (TDS) of the sea water samples were measured. The study revealed that the pH was varied from 8.0 to 8.2, indicating slightly alkaline nature of sea water. The salinity was varied between 27 and 29 Part Per Trillion (ppt), and the temperature ranged from 27 °C to 28.5 °C. The amount of DO was found beyond 5.0 mg/L which is suitable for marine life. Additionally, it was determined that the total dissolved solids were very high. According to the study, beach seawater is generally suitable for recreational uses and not acceptable for the drinking purpose. Therefore, the effective treatment of sea water required due to high salinity and TDS.
